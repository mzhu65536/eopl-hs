# The essence of functional programming

1. Introduction
   - How to use monads to structure a interpreter to introduce IO, error and
     basic evaluation
   - Relationship between Monad and CPS
   - Monad comes from category theory 
2. Interpreting Monads
   - Monad ~type M~
     - ~unitM :: a -> M a~
     - ~bindM :: M a -> (a -> M b) -> M b~
     - ~showM~
     - 
   - changed signature from ~Val~ to ~M Val~
